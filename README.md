#### 1.Without using any deep learning library, Implement the forward pass of neural network. Take filter weights as gaussian or random filter and pooling operation as max-pooling. Initialize the weights randomly and show output after each layer for any sample image.
#### 2.For above architecture, try different activation functions and describe observations.
#### 3. Tensorflow framework:show how the framework works and how to train a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

4. CIFAR-10 Training
• Construct a model that performs well on CIFAR-10.
• Construct an optimizer that performs well on CIFAR-10.
5. Write an explanation of what you did, any additional features that you imple-
mented, and/or any graphs that you made in the process of training and evaluating
your network.
